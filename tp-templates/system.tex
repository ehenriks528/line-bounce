\begin{itemize}
\item Check that invites were received
\item Check that the proper amounts of coins were received
\item Check that response took under 5 seconds to receive
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TES-15.6: Gifting Items}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Determine that the user can gift items to friends and that the
gift cooldown works properly.
\item Testcases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write and run code that will first attempt to gift an item to a friend, 
from 5 valid Facebook accounts to 5 other valid accounts on each platform, 
timing the local responses.
\item The code will then run the same test 10 minutes later to check the 
cooldown function.
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure elapsed time for local response
\item Record local response to gift sending attempts
\item Record what happens on the receiver end
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the gift sending was successful the first time
\item Check that the gift sending was unsuccessful the second time
\item Check that local response took under 5 seconds to receive
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TES-15.7: Payment Processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Determine that the user can make purchases properly, but only 
when authenticated via Facebook.
\item Testcases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write and run code that will first attempt to make several purchases, 
from 5 valid Facebook accounts on each platform, timing the responses.
\item The code will then run then log out the users and attempt the same 
purchases, timing the responses.
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure elapsed time for response
\item Record response to logged in purchase attempts
\item Record response to logged out purchase attempts
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the purchase attempts were successful the first time
\item Check that the purchase attempts were unsuccessful the second time
\item Check that response took under 5 seconds to receive
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TES-15.8: Notifications}
\label{subsec:notifications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Determine that the user properly receives notifications when 
they are enabled and does not receive them when they are disabled.
\item Testcases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write and run code that creates the following scenarios, recording 
what happens when the notification regarding these events should appear. 
The code is run twice, first with notifications enabled and then with 
notifications disabled.
\begin{itemize}
\item User scores higher than a friend\textquoteright{}s high score
\item Friend sends gift to user
\item Friend beats user\textquoteright{}s high score
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Record what happens when the notifications should appear
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the notifications properly appeared when enabled
\item Check that the notifications did not appear when disabled
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TES-15.9: Data Synchronization}
\label{subsec:sync}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Determine that data synchronization works properly across 
all platforms.
\item Testcases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write and run code on each platform, on a different Facebook account 
per platform, to try to synchronize data with the server and see if the 
data is replicated to the other devices.
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Record what happens when synchronization is attempted
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the data is properly synchronized with the server
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TES-15.10: Data Reset}
\label{subsec:reset}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Determine that resetting data works properly on all platforms.
\item Testcases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Write and run code on each platform, on a different Facebook account 
per platform, to try to reset the game data for the Facebook account.
\item Write and run code on each platform, not logged into Facebook, to 
try to reset local game data.
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Record what happens when data resetting is attempted
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the output 
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the data is properly reset account-wide
\item Check that the data is properly reset locally
\end{itemize}
\item Generate report 
\end{itemize}
